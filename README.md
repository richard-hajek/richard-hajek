### Hi, I'm Rich ðŸ‘‹

**I am a founder engineer, AI researcher and designer.**

This is my profile where I post mostly exploratory things.

AI is my main field of work, I specialize in **deep learning** and **reinforced learning**. In order to facilitate as smooth as possible development of my apps, I also have a deep understanding of **git**, **docker**, **python** and **bash**, having led educationary seminars on some of them. 

In my work, I have also used or encountered PyPI, Terraform, Kubernetes, Selenium, C++ and many others.

When I feel so inclined, I create art in Blender or games in Godot. I am interested in quantified self and have a rich background of behavioural self-management.
